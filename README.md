# SSSSG (Super Simple Static Site Generator)

SSSSG is a very simple static site generator written in Python used to render Markdown files.

##Dependencies

* tornado
* markdown
* python-dateutil
* I wrote it in Python 3.5, but there shouldn't be any reason for it not to run in 2.7

##Installation

```python
python setup.py install
```
