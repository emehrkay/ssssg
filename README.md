# ssssg (Super Simple Static Site Generator)

ssssg is a very simple static site generator written in Python used to render Markdown files.

##Dependencies

* tornado
* markdown
* I wrote it in Python 3.5, but there shouldn't be any reason to run in 2.7

##Installation

```python
python setup.py install
```

##Usage

SSSSG is easy to use involving two commands: `run` and `index`. You need to setup your site files with the following rules:

1. Create a directory to store your pages. The directory name will be the name that you reference when you run the site.
2. Store all of your viewable files with a `.md` extension.
3. Add a `static` directory for your static files -- css, js, images, fonts, etc.

```
   /mark.com
       index.md
       about.md
       /static
       	/css
       		mark.css
       	/js
       		mark.js
```

###Pages

Pages are rendered using the markdown package and the `markdown.extensions.meta` extension. This allows for you to add custom meta-data to each page.

####ssssg Supported Meta-data

* Title -- the page title
* Slug -- this will be how the page is referenced in the browser
* Tags -- a comma separated list of tags that you can use to identify a page (this is not in use yet, but it parses and stores the information)

###Administration

Indexing your content and running the application is very simple

__index__

This command's job is to index your site's files.

```
python ssssg.py index /path/to/your/site.name
```

__run__

This command runs the site.

```
python ssssg.py run site.name
```

###Configuration Options

The default setup defines a few configuration options that can be overwritten at run-time:

* __port__ [7007] -- The port used to run the SSSSG app
* __cache\_file_directory__ [CWD + '/../caches'] -- the directory where to write the cache files generated by SSSSG
* __four\_oh_four__ -- The default 404 page to render (should be a .md file)
* __five\_oh_oh__ -- The default 404 page to render (should be a .md file)

To override during run-time simply pass a setting in with prepended by a single dash (-)

```
python ssssg.py run site.name -port=9999 -cache_file_directory=/some/path
```
